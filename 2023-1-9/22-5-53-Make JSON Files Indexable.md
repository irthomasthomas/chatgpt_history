2. Use the correct MIME type: Set the MIME type of your JSON files to "application/json" to let search engines know that they are JSON files.

3. Make your JSON files crawlable: Allow search engines to crawl your JSON files by including them in your sitemap and robots.txt file.

4. Use descriptive and relevant keys: Use descriptive and relevant keys for your JSON data to help search engines understand the context and content of your files.

5. Use unique and consistent URLs: Use unique and consistent URLs for your JSON files to make it easier for search engines to find and index them.

6. Use structured data: Consider using structured data formats like JSON-LD or Microdata to help search engines understand the context and content of your JSON files.
