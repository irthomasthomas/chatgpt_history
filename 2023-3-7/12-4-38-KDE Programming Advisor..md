done > Desktop/dupe_test.csv

## ASSISTANT
This script appears to recursively traverse a directory `/Volumes/magician`, compute the MD5 checksum of the first block of each file, and then create a CSV file named `dupe_test.csv` on the desktop of the current user, containing a list of files that have identical checksums. 

Specifically, the script creates an associative array called `dirs`, where the keys are the base names of the files (i.e., the file names without the leading directory path), and the values are concatenated strings consisting of the MD5 checksum of the first block of the file, a comma, and the full file path. 

The script then loops over the keys of the `dirs` array, checks whether the concatenated value for each key contains the string `*\n*\n*`, which is a delimiter that separates files with identical checksums, and if so, appends the value to the `dupe_test.csv` file. 

Please note that this script assumes that the `shopt` and `declare` commands are supported in your shell environment, and that you have read permissions for all the files under `/Volumes/magician`. If you encounter any errors or issues, please provide more details about the problem.

## USER
Change the script so that instead of making a csv it creates a directory containing symlinks to the files with identical checksums.

## ASSISTANT
Certainly! Here is the modified script that creates a directory called `dupe_files` on the desktop of the current user, and creates symbolic links to the files with identical checksums:

```
declare -A dirs
shopt -s globstar nullglob
mkdir -p ~/Desktop/dupe_files
for f in /Volumes/magician/**; do
    [[ -f $f ]] || continue
    bsum=$(dd count=1 status=none ibs=16000 if="$f" | md5)
    b=${f##*/}
    dirs["$b"]+="$bsum,$f
"
done
multiple=$'*\n*\n*'
for b in "${!dirs[@]}"; do
    if [[ ${dirs["$b"]} == $multiple ]]; then
        dir=~/Desktop/dupe_files/$b
        mkdir -p "$dir"
        IFS=$'\n'
        for file in $(echo "${dirs["$b"]}" | cut -d, -f2-); do
            ln -sf "$file" "$dir/$(basename "$file")"
        done
    fi
done
```

Note that the script now creates a directory `dupe_files` in the user's Desktop folder using the `mkdir -p` command. The `mkdir -p` command creates the directory only if it does not already exist, and creates any missing parent directories as necessary.

The loop that checks for duplicate checksums has been modified to create a directory `dir` in the `dupe_files` folder with the same name as the base name `b` of the files with identical checksums. The loop then creates symbolic links to each of the files in the `dirs["$b"]` array within the `dir` directory using the `ln -sf` command. The `cut` command is used to remove the checksum prefix from the file path.

Please let me know if you have any questions or issues with this modified script.

## USER
Instead of DD, use tail -c 8192

## ASSISTANT
Sure! Here is the modified script that uses `tail -c 8192` instead of `dd count=1 status=none ibs=16000` to compute the MD5 checksum of the first 8KB of each file:

```
declare -A dirs
shopt -s globstar nullglob
mkdir -p ~/Desktop/dupe_files
for f in /Volumes/magician/**; do
    [[ -f $f ]] || continue
    bsum=$(tail -c 8192 "$f" | md5sum | cut -d' ' -f1)
    b=${f##*/}
    dirs["$b"]+="$bsum,$f
"
done
multiple=$'*\n*\n*'
for b in "${!dirs[@]}"; do
    if [[ ${dirs["$b"]} == $multiple ]]; then
        dir=~/Desktop/dupe_files/$b
        mkdir -p "$dir"
        IFS=$'\n'
        for file in $(echo "${dirs["$b"]}" | cut -d, -f2-); do
            ln -sf "$file" "$dir/$(basename "$file")"
        done
    fi
done
```

The only change made to the script is the replacement of the `dd` command with `tail -c 8192` in the `bsum=$(...)` line. The `tail -c 8192` command extracts the last 8192 bytes of the file, which is equivalent to the first 8192 bytes when the file is read from beginning to end. The `md5sum` command computes the MD5 checksum of the extracted bytes, and the `cut` command extracts the checksum value from the output of `md5sum`.

Please let me know if you have any questions or issues with this modified script.

## USER
Now add a step at the start which first groups the files by file size. Then only check the md5 of files with matching file size.

## ASSISTANT
Sure! Here is the modified script that groups the files by size and only checks the MD5 of files with matching sizes:

```
declare -A sizes
shopt -s globstar nullglob
for f in /Volumes/magician/**; do
    [[ -f $f ]] || continue
    size=$(stat -c '%s' "$f")
    sizes["$size"]+="$f
"
done
mkdir -p ~/Desktop/dupe_files
for s in "${!sizes[@]}"; do
    if [[ $(echo "${sizes["$s"]}" | wc -l) -gt 1 ]]; then
        declare -A dirs
        for f in ${sizes["$s"]}; do
            bsum=$(tail -c 8192 "$f" | md5sum | cut -d' ' -f1)
            b=${f##*/}
            dirs["$b"]+="$bsum,$f
"
        done
        multiple=$'*\n*\n*'
        for b in "${!dirs[@]}"; do
            if [[ ${dirs["$b"]} == $multiple ]]; then
                dir=~/Desktop/dupe_files/$b
                mkdir -p "$dir"
                IFS=$'\n'
                for file in $(echo "${dirs["$b"]}" | cut -d, -f2-); do
                    ln -sf "$file" "$dir/$(basename "$file")"
                done
            fi
        done
    fi
done
```

The script now has a new step at the beginning that creates an associative array `sizes`, where the keys are the sizes of the files in bytes, and the values are concatenated strings consisting of the full file paths with matching sizes. 

The loop that checks for duplicate checksums has been modified to first check whether there are multiple files with the same size using the `echo "${sizes["$s"]}" | wc -l` command. If there are, the loop creates an associative array `dirs` for the files with the same size and computes the MD5 checksum of the first 8KB of each file. 

The rest of the script remains the same as before, creating a directory `dir` in the `dupe_files` folder for each set of files with identical checksums and creating symbolic links to the files in the `dirs["$b"]` array within the `dir` directory.

Please let me know if you have any questions or issues with this modified script.

## USER
Change it so that links to both the original and the duplicate are made.

## ASSISTANT
Certainly! Here is the modified script that creates symbolic links to both the original and duplicate files in the `dupe_files` directory:

```
declare -A sizes
shopt -s globstar nullglob
for f in /Volumes/magician/**; do
    [[ -f $f ]] || continue
    size=$(stat -c '%s' "$f")
    sizes["$size"]+="$f
"
done
mkdir -p ~/Desktop/dupe_files
for s in "${!sizes[@]}"; do
    if [[ $(echo "${sizes["$s"]}" | wc -l) -gt 1 ]]; then
        declare -A dirs
        for f in ${sizes["$s"]}; do
            bsum=$(tail -c 8192 "$f" | md5sum | cut -d' ' -f1)
            b=${f##*/}
            dirs["$bsum"]+="$f
"
        done
        multiple=$'*\n*\n*'
        for bsum in "${!dirs[@]}"; do
            if [[ $(echo "${dirs["$bsum"]}" | wc -l) -gt 1 ]]; then
                dir=~/Desktop/dupe_files/$bsum
                mkdir -p "$dir"
                IFS=$'\n'
                for file in $(echo "${dirs["$bsum"]}"); do
                    ln -sf "$file" "$dir/$(basename "$file")"
                done
            fi
        done
    fi
done
```

The modification involves creating a new associative array `dirs` that groups files by MD5 checksum rather than file name. For each set of files with the same size, the script now creates a directory named after the checksum value of the first 8KB of the file. 

The loop that creates symbolic links now loops over the values of the `dirs` array, checking whether there are multiple files with the same checksum using `echo "${dirs["$bsum"]}" | wc -l`. If there are, the loop creates symbolic links to all the files in the `dirs["$bsum"]` array within the `dir` directory using the `ln -sf` command.

Please let me know if you have any questions or issues with this modified script.

## USER
When creating the symlink, if it already exists, add dup$num to filename.

## ASSISTANT
Sure! Here is the modified script that adds `dup$num` to the filename of the symbolic link if it already exists:

```
declare -A sizes
shopt -s globstar nullglob
for f in /Volumes/magician/**; do
    [[ -f $f ]] || continue
    size=$(stat -c '%s' "$f")
    sizes["$size"]+="$f
"
done
mkdir -p ~/Desktop/dupe_files
for s in "${!sizes[@]}"; do
    if [[ $(echo "${sizes["$s"]}" | wc -l) -gt 1 ]]; then
        declare -A dirs
        for f in ${sizes["$s"]}; do
            bsum=$(tail -c 8192 "$f" | md5sum | cut -d' ' -f1)
            b=${f##*/}
            dirs["$bsum"]+="$f
"
        done
        multiple=$'*\n*\n*'
        for bsum in "${!dirs[@]}"; do
            if [[ $(echo "${dirs["$bsum"]}" | wc -l) -gt 1 ]]; then
                dir=~/Desktop/dupe_files/$bsum
                mkdir -p "$dir"
                IFS=$'\n'
                i=0
                for file in $(echo "${dirs["$bsum"]}"); do
                    i=$((i+1))
                    base=$(basename "$file")
                    link="$dir/$base"
                    if [[ -e "$link" ]]; then
                        dupnum=1
                        while [[ -e "$link.dup$dupnum" ]]; do
                            dupnum=$((dupnum+1))
                        done
                        link="$link.dup$dupnum"
                    fi
                    ln -sf "$file" "$link"
                done
            fi
        done
    fi
done
```

The modification involves adding a loop counter variable `i` to the loop that creates symbolic links. For each file, the script now checks whether a symbolic link with the same name already exists in the `dir` directory using the `-e` test operator. If it does, the script increments a `dupnum` counter variable and adds it to the filename of the symbolic link using the `.dup$dupnum` suffix. The script continues to increment `dupnum` until a unique filename is found.

Please let me know if you have any questions or issues with this modified script.

## USER
This is creating infinite duplicates.

## ASSISTANT
I apologize for the error. The infinite duplicates issue is occurring because the `dupnum` counter variable is being incremented every time the script encounters an existing symbolic link with the same name, even if that link was created in a previous run of the script. 

To fix the issue, we can modify the script to first check whether the symbolic link already contains the `.dup` suffix before incrementing the `dupnum` counter. Here is the modified script with this change:

```
declare -A sizes
shopt -s globstar nullglob
for f in /Volumes/magician/**; do
    [[ -f $f ]] || continue
    size=$(stat -c '%s' "$f")
    sizes["$size"]+="$f
"
done
mkdir -p ~/Desktop/dupe_files
for s in "${!sizes[@]}"; do
    if [[ $(echo "${sizes["$s"]}" | wc -l) -gt 1 ]]; then
        declare -A dirs
        for f in ${sizes["$s"]}; do
            bsum=$(tail -c 8192 "$f" | md5sum | cut -d' ' -f1)
            b=${f##*/}
            dirs["$bsum"]+="$f
"
        done
        multiple=$'*\n*\n*'
        for bsum in "${!dirs[@]}"; do
            if [[ $(echo "${dirs["$bsum"]}" | wc -l) -gt 1 ]]; then
                dir=~/Desktop/dupe_files/$bsum
                mkdir -p "$dir"
                IFS=$'\n'
                for file in $(echo "${dirs["$bsum"]}"); do
                    base=$(basename "$file")
                    link="$dir/$base"
                    if [[ -e "$link" ]]; then
                        dupnum=1
                        while [[ -e "$link" || "$link" == *.dup* ]]; do
                            link="$dir/${base}.dup${dupnum}"
                            dupnum=$((dupnum+1))
                        done
                    fi
                    ln -sf "$file" "$link"
                done
            fi
        done
    fi
done
```

The script now checks whether the existing symbolic link already contains the `.dup` suffix using the `[[ "$link" == *.dup* ]]` pattern matching test before incrementing the `dupnum` counter. The `while` loop continues to increment `dupnum` and update the `link` variable until a unique filename is found.

Please let me know if you have any questions or issues with this modified script.
