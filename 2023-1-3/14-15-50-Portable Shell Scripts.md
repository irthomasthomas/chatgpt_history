Which shell script is compatible with the most computers?

## ASSISTANT
The most portable shell script is one that is written to be compatible with the POSIX shell, which is a standard shell that is widely available on many different operating systems. This includes systems that use the Bourne shell (such as Linux and macOS) as well as the Korn shell (such as Solaris and AIX). By writing your scripts to be compatible with the POSIX shell, you can ensure that they will work on the widest range of systems.

Here are some tips for writing portable shell scripts:

- Use only POSIX-compliant features of the shell.
- Avoid using shell-specific features or syntax.
- Test your scripts on a variety of systems to ensure compatibility.

By following these guidelines, you can write shell scripts that are compatible with a wide range of computers.
