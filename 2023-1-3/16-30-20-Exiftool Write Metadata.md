Explain this: exiftool -tagsfromfile "$FILEPATH" "$trimmed_filename"

## ASSISTANT
`exiftool` is a command-line utility for reading, writing, and editing metadata information in image and audio files. 

The `-tagsfromfile` option tells exiftool to read the metadata from the file specified by `$FILEPATH` and write the metadata to the file specified by `$trimmed_filename`. 

So this command is taking the metadata from the file specified by `$FILEPATH` and writing it to the file specified by `$trimmed_filename`. 

For example, if `$FILEPATH` is the path to a file called `image.jpg` and `$trimmed_filename` is the path to a file called `image_trimmed.jpg`, then this command would read the metadata from `image.jpg` and write it to `image_trimmed.jpg`.

## USER
FILEPATH is a dji drone video. Will that command transfer all of the metadata for that file?

## ASSISTANT
Yes, the `-tagsfromfile` option will transfer all of the metadata from the source file specified by `$FILEPATH` to the destination file specified by `$trimmed_filename`. This includes all of the metadata tags that exiftool is able to read and write, such as EXIF metadata, IPTC metadata, and XMP metadata.

It's worth noting that exiftool may not be able to read or write all possible types of metadata, depending on the format of the file and the specific metadata tags involved. However, for common image and audio file formats, exiftool is able to read and write a wide range of metadata tags.
