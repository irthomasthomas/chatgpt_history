How should professional programmers organize their linux home directory 

## ASSISTANT
There isn't a one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as different programmers have different workflows and preferences. However, there are a few general guidelines that you might find helpful:

1. Create a separate directory for each project you work on. This will help keep your work organized and separate.

2. Consider using version control (e.g. Git) to manage your code. This will allow you to track changes to your code over time and collaborate with other developers more easily.

3. Keep your development tools (e.g. text editor, compiler) in a separate directory. This will make it easier to find them when you need them.

4. Use a consistent naming scheme for your files and directories. This will make it easier to find what you're looking for.

5. Keep your home directory clean and organized. This will make it easier to find things and keep your work environment clutter-free.

Remember that the most important thing is to find a system that works for you and your workflow. Don't be afraid to experiment and try out different approaches until you find one that works for you.

## USER
suggest a comprehensive scheme based on 4. sticking to convention.

## ASSISTANT
Sure! Here is a possible directory structure that follows common conventions:

- `~/bin`: This directory is for personal executables and scripts.

- `~/src`: This directory is for source code for projects you are working on.

- `~/lib`: This directory is for libraries that you use in your projects.

- `~/doc`: This directory is for documentation for projects you are working on.

- `~/etc`: This directory is for configuration files.

- `~/tmp`: This directory is for temporary files.

- `~/data`: This directory is for data files used by your projects.

- `~/media`: This directory is for media files such as images and videos.

- `~/downloads`: This directory is for downloaded files.

This is just one possible directory structure, and you may find that you need to customize it to suit your needs. The important thing is to use a consistent and logical naming scheme so that you can easily find the files you need.

## USER
remember that we are organizing a programmers home directory.

## ASSISTANT
In that case, here is an updated directory structure that is more specific to a programmer's needs:

- `~/projects`: This directory is for source code for projects you are working on. You can create a separate subdirectory for each project.

- `~/tools`: This directory is for development tools such as text editors, compilers, and debuggers.

- `~/libraries`: This directory is for libraries that you use in your projects.

- `~/docs`: This directory is for documentation for projects you are working on, as well as general programming reference material.

- `~/config`: This directory is for configuration files for your development tools and projects.

- `~/temp`: This directory is for temporary files.

- `~/data`: This directory is for data files used by your projects.

- `~/media`: This directory is for media files such as images and videos.

- `~/downloads`: This directory is for downloaded files.

Again, this is just one possible directory structure, and you may find that you need to customize it to suit your needs. The important thing is to use a consistent and logical naming scheme so that you can easily find the files you need. 

## USER
what other schemes have other professional programmers recommended

## ASSISTANT
Here are a few other directory structures that other professional programmers have recommended:

- `~/code`: This directory is for source code for all of your projects. You can create a separate subdirectory for each project.

- `~/src`: This directory is for source code for all of your projects. You can create a separate subdirectory for each project.

- `~/work`: This directory is for all of your work-related files, including source code, documentation, and configuration files. You can create a separate subdirectory for each project.

- `~/projects`: This directory is for all of your projects. You can create a separate subdirectory for each project, and within each project directory, you can create subdirectories for source code, documentation, and other project-specific files.

Ultimately, the best directory structure for you will depend on your personal preferences and workflow. It's important to find a structure that works for you and helps you stay organized.

## USER
To organise my videos for posting online, I have written a bash script that extracts a clip from an mp4 video, called extract_clip.sh. Which directory would keep that file in?

## ASSISTANT
If the `extract_clip.sh` script is a personal executable or script that you use frequently, you could keep it in the `~/bin` directory. This is a common location for personal executables and scripts.

Alternatively, you could keep the script in the same directory as the video files that it processes. This might make it easier to find the script when you need to use it, and it can also help to keep related files together.

Ultimately, the choice of directory will depend on your personal preference and workflow. The important thing is to choose a location that makes sense to you and helps you stay organized.

## USER
And based on the examples you gave for a home directory structure, would you also keep a copy of the source code somewhere in your home directory?

## ASSISTANT
Yes, if you are working on a project that involves source code, it is typically a good idea to keep a copy of the source code in your home directory.

One option is to create a `~/projects` directory and keep a separate subdirectory for each project. Within each project directory, you can keep the source code and any other project-specific files.

Alternatively, you could create a `~/src` directory and keep all of your source code in that directory, or create a `~/code` directory and keep all of your code (including source code and executables) in that directory.

Again, the important thing is to find a directory structure that works for you and helps you stay organized. 

## USER
In addition to the script mentioned, I have written many other shell scripts to perform a wide variety of tasks. How should I organise those? Should a make a git repository for them?

## ASSISTANT
It can be helpful to organize your shell scripts into a logical directory structure to make it easier to find the scripts you need when you need them. Here are a few options for organizing your scripts:

- Create a separate directory for each category of scripts. For example, you could create a `~/scripts/system` directory for scripts that perform system tasks, a `~/scripts/network` directory for scripts that manage network connections, and a `~/scripts/utility` directory for general-purpose utility scripts.

- Create a separate directory for each project that you work on, and keep the scripts specific to that project in the project directory.

- Create a `~/bin` directory and keep all of your personal executables and scripts in that directory.

Using version control (e.g. Git) can also be a useful way to manage your scripts. You could create a Git repository for your scripts and use version control to track changes to your code over time. This can be especially helpful if you collaborate with other developers or if you have a large number of scripts that you need to keep track of.

Ultimately, the best approach will depend on your personal preferences and workflow. It's important to find a system that works for you and helps you stay organized.

## USER
Organisation

my scripts directory contains the following scripts. How can I organise these? I want some of them to be in a public git.

getcurrentactivity.sh - gets the name of the current activity in KDE Activities.
ToTrelloDesign.sh - sends the link to the Trello board called "Design"
ToTrelloResearch.sh - sends the link to the Trello board called "Research"
exif-rename.sh - renames all media files to the created_date.
file-modified-watch.sh - Uses inotifywait to watch every file on the / and print a line each time a file changes.
rename-dir-from-child.sh - This renames a directory using the name of a file it contains. Used for example on directories containing panorama raw files, or a timelapse series.
mkramdisk.sh - creates a 10GB ram disk.
znoise.sh - runs a stack of photos through Hugin's zero noise function, to produce an image with reduced noise.
organise-pano-and-hyper-files.sh - uses the exif-rename.sh and rename-dir-from-child.sh to organise a big directory of photos from different sessions.
new-linux-install.sh - used on a new installation of linux to install my favorite apps.
chatgpt-test.sh - has numerous tools created with chatgpt.
find_keyframes.sh - Takes a video, start_time, and end_time and finds the nearest keyframes.
compare_2_texts.sh - Shows a diff for two blocks of text entered.
extract_video_section_from_mp4.sh - takes an mp4 and extracts a section between the start_time and end_time.

## ASSISTANT
Here are a few suggestions for organizing the scripts you listed:

- Create a `~/scripts` directory and keep all of your scripts in that directory. You can then create subdirectories within `~/scripts` to further organize your scripts by category. For example, you could create a `system` subdirectory for scripts that perform system tasks, a `network` subdirectory for scripts that manage network connections, and a `utility` subdirectory for general-purpose utility scripts.

- Create a separate Git repository for each script or group of related scripts. This will allow you to track changes to each script individually and make it easier to collaborate with others on specific scripts.

- Create a single Git repository for all of your scripts and use branches to organize them. For example, you could create a `system` branch for scripts that perform system tasks, a `network` branch for scripts that manage network connections, and a `utility` branch for general-purpose utility scripts.

Again, the best approach will depend on your personal preferences and workflow. It's important to find a system that works for you and helps you stay organized. 

## USER
ok now write a script that creates the recommended directories and copies each file I listed into the appropriate directory. Leave a copy of the original files in the original directory.

## ASSISTANT
Here is a bash script that creates the recommended directories and copies each file into the appropriate directory:

```
# Create the recommended directories
mkdir -p ~/scripts/system
mkdir -p ~/scripts/network
mkdir -p ~/scripts/utility

# Copy the files into the appropriate directories
cp getcurrentactivity.sh ~/scripts/system
cp ToTrelloDesign.sh ~/scripts/network
cp ToTrelloResearch.sh ~/scripts/network
cp exif-rename.sh ~/scripts/utility
cp file-modified-watch.sh ~/scripts/system
cp rename-dir-from-child.sh ~/scripts/utility
cp mkramdisk.sh ~/scripts/system
cp znoise.sh ~/scripts/utility
cp organise-pano-and-hyper-files.sh ~/scripts/utility
cp new-linux-install.sh ~/scripts/system
cp chatgpt-test.sh ~/scripts/utility
cp find_keyframes.sh ~/scripts/utility
cp compare_2_texts.sh ~/scripts/utility
cp extract_video_section_from_mp4.sh ~/scripts/utility
```

This script assumes that all of the files you listed are in the same directory. If the files are in different directories, you will need to specify the full path to each file when copying it.

This script also leaves a copy of the original files in the original directory. If you want to move the files rather than copying them, you can use the `mv` command instead of the `cp` command.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

## USER
try again with a more accurate structure based on my file descriptions. Dont use a network directory this time for the Trello scripts.

## ASSISTANT
Sure! Here is a revised version of the script that creates a more accurate directory structure based on the descriptions of your files:

```
# Create the recommended directories
mkdir -p ~/scripts/system
mkdir -p ~/scripts/utility
mkdir -p ~/scripts/video

# Copy the files into the appropriate directories
cp getcurrentactivity.sh ~/scripts/system
cp exif-rename.sh ~/scripts/utility
cp file-modified-watch.sh ~/scripts/system
cp rename-dir-from-child.sh ~/scripts/utility
cp mkramdisk.sh ~/scripts/system
cp znoise.sh ~/scripts/utility
cp organise-pano-and-hyper-files.sh ~/scripts/utility
cp new-linux-install.sh ~/scripts/system
cp chatgpt-test.sh ~/scripts/utility
cp compare_2_texts.sh ~/scripts/utility

# Trello scripts don't fit into the "system", "utility", or "video" categories, so create a separate "trello" directory for them
mkdir -p ~/scripts/trello
cp ToTrelloDesign.sh ~/scripts/trello
cp ToTrelloResearch.sh ~/scripts/trello

cp find_keyframes.sh ~/scripts/video
cp extract_video_section_from_mp4.sh ~/scripts/video
```

This script assumes that all of the files you listed are in the same directory. If the files are in different directories, you will need to specify the full path to each file when copying it.

This script also leaves a copy of the original files in the original directory. If you want to move the files rather than copying them, you can use the `mv` command instead of the `cp` command.

## USER
the znoise and organise-pano... scripts are related to my photography workflow. Should they be stored in /utility?

## ASSISTANT
The `znoise` and `organise-pano-and-hyper-files.sh` scripts are related to your photography workflow, so you might consider creating a separate directory for them within the `~/scripts` directory.

One option is to create a `~/scripts/photography` directory and keep the `znoise` and `organise-pano-and-hyper-files.sh` scripts in that directory. This will help you keep your photography-related scripts organized and separate from your other scripts.

Alternatively, you could create a `~/photography` directory and keep all of your photography-related scripts, tools, and files in that directory. This might be a good option if you have a large number of photography-related scripts and files and you want to keep them all in a single location.

Ultimately, the best approach will depend on your personal preferences and workflow. It's important to find a system that works for you and helps you stay organized.

## USER
proceed with the same.

## ASSISTANT
Sure! Here is a revised version of the script that creates a `~/scripts/photography` directory and keeps the `znoise` and `organise-pano-and-hyper-files.sh` scripts in that directory:

```
# Create the recommended directories
mkdir -p ~/scripts/system
mkdir -p ~/scripts/utility
mkdir -p ~/scripts/video
mkdir -p ~/scripts/photography

# Copy the files into the appropriate directories
cp getcurrentactivity.sh ~/scripts/system
cp exif-rename.sh ~/scripts/utility
cp file-modified-watch.sh ~/scripts/system
cp rename-dir-from-child.sh ~/scripts/utility
cp mkramdisk.sh ~/scripts/system
cp znoise.sh ~/scripts/photography
cp organise-pano-and-hyper-files.sh ~/scripts/photography
cp new-linux-install.sh ~/scripts/system
cp chatgpt-test.sh ~/scripts/utility
cp compare_2_texts.sh ~/scripts/utility

# Trello scripts don't fit into the "system", "utility", "photography", or "video" categories, so create a separate "trello" directory for them
mkdir -p ~/scripts/trello
cp ToTrelloDesign.sh ~/scripts/trello
cp ToTrelloResearch.sh ~/scripts/trello

cp find_keyframes.sh ~/scripts/video
cp extract_video_section_from_mp4.sh ~/scripts/video
```

This script assumes that all of the files you listed are in the same directory. If the files are in different directories, you will need to specify the full path to each file when copying it.

This script also leaves a copy of the original files in the original directory. If you want to move the files rather than copying them, you can use the `mv` command instead of the `cp` command.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

## USER
From my list of files and their descriptions. Should any be renamed?

## ASSISTANT
It's generally a good idea to give your files descriptive and meaningful names to help you and others understand their purpose. Here are a few suggestions for renaming some of the files you listed:

- `getcurrentactivity.sh`: This name is clear and concise, and it accurately describes the purpose of the script. No change is needed.

- `ToTrelloDesign.sh`: This name is clear and concise, and it accurately describes the purpose of the script. No change is needed.

- `ToTrelloResearch.sh`: This name is clear and concise, and it accurately describes the purpose of the script. No change is needed.

- `exif-rename.sh`: This name is clear and concise, and it accurately describes the purpose of the script. No change is needed.

- `file-modified-watch.sh`: This name is clear and concise, and it accurately describes the purpose of the script. No change is needed.

- `rename-dir-from-child.sh`: This name is clear and concise, and it accurately describes the purpose of the script. No change is needed.

- `mkramdisk.sh`: This name is clear and concise, and it accurately describes the purpose of the script. No change is needed.

- `znoise.

## USER
From my list of files and descriptions. Rename each file to be more readable and compliant with linux best practice.

## ASSISTANT
Sure! Here are some revised names for the files you listed that are more readable and comply with Linux best practices:

- `get_current_activity.sh`: This name is more readable and follows the convention of using underscores to separate words.

- `send_link_to_trello_design_board.sh`: This name is more descriptive and follows the convention of using underscores to separate words.

- `send_link_to_trello_research_board.sh`: This name is more descriptive and follows the convention of using underscores to separate words.

- `rename_media_files_by_creation_date.sh`: This name is more descriptive and follows the convention of using underscores to separate words.

- `watch_files_for_modifications.sh`: This name is more descriptive and follows the convention of using underscores to separate words.

- `rename_directory_from_child_file.sh`: This name is more descriptive and follows the convention of using underscores to separate words.

- `create_10GB_ram_disk.sh`: This name is more descriptive and follows the convention of using underscores to separate words.

- `run_photos_through_zero_noise_function.sh`: This name is more descriptive and follows the convention of using underscores to separate words.

- `organize_panorama_and_hyperlapse_files.sh`: This name is more descriptive and follows the convention of using underscores to separate words.

- `install_favorite_apps_on_new_linux_system.sh`: This name is more descriptive and follows the convention of using underscores to separate words.

- `test_chatgpt_tools.sh`: This name is more descriptive and follows the convention of using underscores to separate words.

- `find_nearest_keyframes.sh`: This name is more descriptive and follows the convention of using underscores to separate words.

- `compare_two_blocks_of_text.sh`: This name is more descriptive and follows the convention of using underscores to separate words.

- `extract_section_from_mp4_

## USER
I don't like that new zero_noise name.

## ASSISTANT
Certainly! Here is an alternative name for the `run_photos_through_zero_noise_function.sh` script that might be more to your liking:

- `reduce_noise_in_photos.sh`: This name is more descriptive and follows the convention of using underscores to separate words. It might be a more intuitive name for the script if you are working with a team or if you plan to share the script with others.

Alternatively, you could choose a different name that better reflects the purpose of the script. The important thing is to choose a name that is descriptive, meaningful, and easy to understand.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

## USER
is it normal to use long descriptions in the name of shell scripts?

## ASSISTANT
It is generally a good idea to give your shell scripts descriptive and meaningful names to help you and others understand their purpose. However, it's also important to strike a balance between having a descriptive name and having a name that is too long or unwieldy.

In general, it's a good idea to keep your script names short and concise, while still being descriptive enough to convey the purpose of the script. A name that is too long or difficult to understand can be frustrating to work with, especially if you or others are typing it out frequently.

That being said, there is no hard and fast rule for how long a script name should be. The best approach will depend on your personal preferences and the specific needs of your project. It's important to find a naming convention that works for you and helps you stay organized.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
