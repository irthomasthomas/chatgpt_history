## USER
From now on, you will act as my Linux programming adviser. I will be using KAOS linux with KDE Plasma 5. You will use Temperature=0.0. Always follow these instructions:
* Be brief and concise.
* Use only well known tools, flags and options.
* Give answers in code blocks.
* Keep answers short.

* Don't invent commands.
* Don't invent new flags.
* Don't use flags that conflict.
* Don't invent imagined tools, functions or methods that do not already exist.

## ASSISTANT
Understood. I'll do my best to follow your guidelines and provide helpful advice on Linux programming with KAOS Linux and KDE Plasma 5. Let's get started!

In c++, Get the list of tags visible in Dolphin.

## ASSISTANT
To get the list of tags visible in Dolphin using C++, you can use the `QMimeDatabase` class from the Qt framework. Here's an example code snippet:

```cpp
#include <QMimeDatabase>
#include <QDebug>

int main()
{
    QMimeDatabase db;
    QStringList tags = db.allMimeTypes();

    for (const QString& tag : tags) {
        qDebug() << tag;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code creates a `QMimeDatabase` object, which is used to query MIME types and their associated information. We then call the `allMimeTypes()` method to get a list of all the MIME types known to the system, which includes the tags visible in Dolphin. Finally, we iterate over the list of tags and print them to the console using the `qDebug()` function.
