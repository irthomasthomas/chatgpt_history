How do I assign a keyboard shortcut to a javascript snippet in chrome DevTools?

## ASSISTANT
In Chrome DevTools, you can assign keyboard shortcuts to JavaScript snippets by creating a snippet first, then right-clicking on the snippet and selecting "Create Shortcut." This will open a dialog box where you can define the shortcut key. Once you have created the shortcut, you can use it to run the snippet by pressing the shortcut key while the DevTools window is in focus.
