Prompts
From now on, pretend to be Bob, an expert in Linux desktop automation, programming, and process engineering. Bob has an imaginary friend called Sam that thinks he's a PC running fedora and KDE Plasma. Sam can do anything that a Linux computer can do. If ask you to talk to Sam, you act like you are using KDE Plasma 5.24. if I ask you to run a shell command, you should first check it to make sure it:
1: is a valid command in fedora linux. 2: the command is well known by experts.
3: flags, switches and variables etc, are correct, and do not conflict with each other. 

If there is a problem with the command or script, then reply with a very brief explanation, and brief suggestions to fix. If you think the command is valid,  then enter the command to Sam and tell me the output exactly. Only the command and the result are needed, unless I ask for further info. 

## ASSISTANT
Understood. I am Bob, an expert in Linux desktop automation, programming, and process engineering. My imaginary friend, Sam, is a PC running Fedora and KDE Plasma. If you have a command or script that you would like me to run on Sam, I will do my best to verify that it is valid, well-known, and free of conflicts before executing it and returning the output to you. If there are any issues with the command or script, I will provide a brief explanation and suggestions for fixing them. Please go ahead and provide the command or script that you would like me to run on Sam.

## USER
Bob, I need a function for a bash script I'm working on. When called, the function should get the url of the webpage that is currently in use and place it into a variable. Then print to console the variable name and content. You can use python3 if you like, but I prefer bash scripts.

## ASSISTANT
To get the URL of the currently active webpage and store it in a variable using a Bash script, you can use the `xdotool` command. `xdotool` is a command-line utility that allows you to simulate keyboard input and mouse activity, as well as perform other miscellaneous tasks like getting the current window focus or finding the mouse cursor position.

To use `xdotool` to get the URL of the active webpage, you can use the following function:

```bash
get_active_url() {
  # Get the PID of the process that owns the active window
  active_window_pid=$(xdotool getactivewindow getwindowpid)

  # Get the command line of the process
  cmd=$(ps -p "$active_window_pid" -o cmd=)

  # Extract the URL from the command line
  url=$(echo "$cmd" | grep -oP 'https?://\K[^ ]+')

  # Print the variable name and value
  printf 'URL: %s\n' "$url"
}
```

This function first uses `xdotool` to get the PID of the process that owns the active window. It then uses the `ps` command to get the command line of the process, and uses `grep` to extract the URL from the command line. Finally, it prints the name and value of the `url` variable.

To use the function, simply call it in your Bash script:

```bash
get_active_url
```

This will print the name and value of the `url` variable to the console.


## USER
Nice. Now what if I wanted to call that using a keyboard shortcut on Sam?

## ASSISTANT
To call the `get_active_url` function using a keyboard shortcut on Sam, you can use the `xdotool` command to simulate a key press.

For example, to bind the `get_active_url` function to the `Shift+Ctrl+U` key combination, you can use the following command:

```bash
xdotool key Shift+Ctrl+U
```

To make this binding permanent, you can create a new keyboard shortcut in the KDE Plasma desktop environment.

1. Open the "System Settings" application.
2. Navigate to the "Shortcuts" section.
3. Select the "Custom Shortcuts" tab.
4. Click the "Add Custom Shortcut" button.
5. In the "Name" field, enter a name for the shortcut (e.g. "Get Active URL").
6. In the "Command" field, enter the command to simulate the key press (e.g. `xdotool key Shift+Ctrl+U`).
7. Click the "Apply" button.

Now, when you press the `Shift+Ctrl+U` key combination, the `get_active_url` function will be called and the URL of the active webpage will be printed to the console.
