convert aac to mp3 in ffmpeg

## ASSISTANT
To convert an AAC file to MP3 using ffmpeg, you can use the following command:

```
ffmpeg -i input.aac -acodec libmp3lame -ab 128k output.mp3
```

This command tells ffmpeg to take the input file named "input.aac" and use the libmp3lame codec to encode it with a bitrate of 128kbps, then save the output to a file named "output.mp3".


## USER
Split an mp3 file into 3

## ASSISTANT
To split an MP3 file into 3 parts using ffmpeg, you can use the command
```
ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -f segment -segment_time 60 -c copy -map 0 output%03d.mp3
```
This command tells ffmpeg to take the input file named "input.mp3" and split it every 60 seconds using the copy codec, then save the output files with names like "output001.mp3", "output002.mp3", "output003.mp3", etc.
You can replace the 60 with any time you want for each segment.

Note that this will create segments with no overlap, so the last segment may be shorter than the specified segment time.
