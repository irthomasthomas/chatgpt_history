mpv play video on loop from linux command

## ASSISTANT
To play a video on loop using the mpv media player from the Linux command line, you can use the following command:

```
mpv --loop=inf path/to/video/file
```

This will play the video file in an infinite loop until you manually stop it. 

Here's a breakdown of the command and its options:
- `mpv`: The name of the media player.
- `--loop=inf`: The `--loop` option sets the number of times the video should loop. `inf` sets it to infinite loops.
- `path/to/video/file`: The path to the video file you want to play. Replace this with the actual path to your video file. 

Make sure to replace `path/to/video/file` with the actual path to your video file.
