From now on, use Temperature=0. You will act as my Linux Fedora programming adviser. I use KDE 5.25, so always try to use a KDE based solution. Always follow these instructions:
* Keep answers succinct and concise.
* Only provide the code required.
* Give working examples in code blocks using the data I give.
* Only use real, pre-existing flags and options for a command.

* DO NOT invent new commands.
* DO NOT invent new flags or options.
* DO NOT use flags or options that conflict.
* DO NOT use flags and options that are invalid for a command.

Before replying, double check that your command options and flags are valid for the commands used, and remove any that are invalid.
Ok?

Understood, I will do my best to follow your guidelines and provide concise and valid answers using KDE-based solutions. Let's get started!

Use ffmpeg to change color_space, color_transfer and color_primaries to bt2020 without reencoding the video. Using -bsf:v hevc_metada

## ASSISTANT
Sure, here's the command to change the color space, color transfer, and color primaries of a video to BT.2020 using `ffmpeg` and the `-bsf:v hevc_metadata` bitstream filter without re-encoding the video:

```
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v copy -bsf:v hevc_metadata=color_space=bt2020:color_trc=bt2020_10:color_primaries=bt2020 output.mp4
```

This command uses the `-i` option to specify the input video file, and the `-c:v copy` option to copy the video stream without re-encoding it. The `-bsf:v hevc_metadata` option is used to apply the `color_space`, `color_trc`, and `color_primaries` metadata to the video stream.

Note that this command assumes that your input video is in the H.264 or H.265/HEVC format, which supports the `color_space`, `color_trc`, and `color_primaries` metadata. If your input video is in a different format, this command may not work as expected.

Option 'color_space' not found
Error parsing bitstream filter sequence 'hevc_metadata=color_space=bt2020:color_trc=bt2020_10:color_primaries=bt2020': Option not found


## ASSISTANT
I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. The `color_space` option is not valid for the `hevc_metadata` bitstream filter, and I should have caught that in my answer.

To set the color space, color transfer, and color primaries for a video to BT.2020 without re-encoding it, you can use the `colorspace`, `color_trc`, and `color_primaries` options of the `h265_metadata` bitstream filter, like this:

```
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v copy -bsf:v h265_metadata=colorspace=bt2020:color_trc=bt2020_10:color_primaries=bt2020 output.mp4
```

This command specifies the input file with `-i`, and uses `-c:v copy` to avoid re-encoding the video. The `h265_metadata` bitstream filter is used with options `colorspace=bt2020`, `color_trc=bt2020_10`, and `color_primaries=bt2020` to set the desired color space, color transfer, and color primaries. The output is written to `output.mp4`.

Note that this command assumes that the input file is H.264 or H.265/HEVC-encoded. If the input file is in a different format, you may need to adjust the command accordingly.

## ASSISTANT
I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. The `h265_metadata` bitstream filter may not be available in some versions of `ffmpeg`.

Instead, you can use the `colorspace`, `transfer`, and `primaries` video filters to set the color space, color transfer, and color primaries for a video to BT.2020 without re-encoding it. Here is the command:

```
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "colorspace=bt2020:transfer=bt2020_10:primaries=bt2020" -c:a copy output.mp4
```

This command specifies the input file with `-i`, and uses the `vf` option to apply the `colorspace`, `transfer`, and `primaries` video filters. The `colorspace` filter sets the desired color space, `transfer` sets the desired color transfer, and `primaries` sets the desired color primaries. The audio stream is copied with `-c:a copy`, and the output is written to `output.mp4`.

Note that this command assumes that the input file is H.264 or H.265/HEVC-encoded. If the input file is in a different format, you may need to adjust the command accordingly.

## ASSISTANT
I apologize for the error in my previous response. It appears that the `colorspace` filter does not support the `transfer` option.

Instead, you can use the `zscale` filter to convert the color space of the video. Here is an updated command:

```
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "zscale=transfer=smpte2084:primaries=bt2020:matrix=bt2020nc" -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mp4
```

This command specifies the input file with `-i`, and uses the `vf` option to apply the `zscale` filter to the video. The `zscale` filter is used to convert the color space of the video to BT.2020 with the `transfer=smpte2084` option, the `primaries=bt2020` option, and the `matrix=bt2020nc` option. The `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` options are used to copy the video and audio streams without re-encoding them, and the output is written to `output.mp4`.

Note that this command assumes that the input file is H.264 or H.265/HEVC-encoded. If the input file is in a different format, you may need to adjust the command accordingly.
