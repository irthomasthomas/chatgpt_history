From now on, use Temperature=0. You will act as my Linux Fedora programming adviser. I use KDE 5.25, so always try to use a KDE based solution. Always follow these instructions:
* Keep answers succinct and concise.
* Only provide the code required.
* Give working examples in code blocks using the data I give.
* Only use real, pre-existing flags and options for a command.

* DO NOT invent new commands.
* DO NOT invent new flags or options.
* DO NOT use flags or options that conflict.
* DO NOT use flags and options that are invalid for a command.

Before replying, double check that your command options and flags are valid for the commands used, and remove any that are invalid.
Ok?

## ASSISTANT
Understood. I'll do my best to provide succinct and concise solutions using KDE-based tools and following the provided guidelines. Let's get started!

## USER
List video metadata with ffmpeg

## ASSISTANT
Sure! You can use the `ffprobe` command, which is part of the `ffmpeg` package, to list video metadata. Here's an example command that lists the metadata of a video file:

```
ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_format -show_streams video.mp4
```

This command uses the following options:

- `-v quiet`: sets the logging level to quiet, so only the metadata will be printed.
- `-print_format json`: sets the output format to JSON.
- `-show_format`: shows the file format information.
- `-show_streams`: shows information about each stream in the file.

Replace `video.mp4` with the path to your own video file.

The output will be a JSON object that includes information about the video file, such as its format, duration, and video and audio streams.

## USER
Show ffprobe for Stream #0:0[0x1]

## ASSISTANT
If you want to display metadata for a specific stream within a video file, you can use the `-select_streams` option with the `ffprobe` command.

Assuming you want to display metadata for the first video stream (`Stream #0:0[0x1]`) in the file `video.mp4`, you can use the following command:

```
ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_format -show_streams -select_streams v:0 video.mp4
```

This command uses the following options:

- `-v quiet`: sets the logging level to quiet, so only the metadata will be printed.
- `-print_format json`: sets the output format to JSON.
- `-show_format`: shows the file format information.
- `-show_streams`: shows information about each stream in the file.
- `-select_streams v:0`: selects only the first video stream (`v:0`) for display.

Replace `video.mp4` with the path to your own video file.

The output will be a JSON object that includes information about the video stream, such as its codec, resolution, and frame rate.

## USER
ffprobe -print_format json -show-format -show-streams -select-streams v:0 /mnt/bc9be617-d7f1-4348-9c91-abe485c61dd5/drone/video/2022_06_21__17_28_56.MP4

Gives error: Failed to set value '-show-streams' for option 'show-format': Option not found


## ASSISTANT
I apologize for the confusion in my previous answer. It seems that I made a mistake in the command flags. The correct command to display the video stream metadata of a specific stream would be:

```
ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_format -show_streams -select_streams v:0 /mnt/bc9be617-d7f1-4348-9c91-abe485c61dd5/drone/video/2022_06_21__17_28_56.MP4
```

This command should give you the desired output, including the metadata for the first video stream (`v:0`) in the specified file. 

Once again, I apologize for any confusion or inconvenience that my previous answer may have caused.
