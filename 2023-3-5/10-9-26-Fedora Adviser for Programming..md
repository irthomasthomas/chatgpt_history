## ASSISTANT
Understood. Please let me know how I can assist you with Linux Fedora programming.

ffmpeg -hide_banner -v warning -ss "$START_TIME" -to "$END_TIME" -i "$FILEPATH" -c copy -y "$output_tmp_path" 2>&1 >/dev/null &


## ASSISTANT
This command uses the ffmpeg tool to extract a portion of a video file specified by the `$FILEPATH` variable, starting at the time `$START_TIME` and ending at the time `$END_TIME`. The extracted portion is saved to the file specified by the `$output_tmp_path` variable.

Here's what each flag and option means:

- `-hide_banner`: hide the FFmpeg banner on startup
- `-v warning`: set the logging level to warning
- `-ss "$START_TIME"`: set the start time to `$START_TIME`
- `-to "$END_TIME"`: set the end time to `$END_TIME`
- `-i "$FILEPATH"`: input file path
- `-c copy`: copy the video and audio streams without re-encoding
- `-y`: overwrite output files without asking
- `"$output_tmp_path"`: output file path
- `2>&1 >/dev/null`: redirect standard error to standard output, and then redirect standard output to `/dev/null` (discard the output)
- `&`: run the command in the background

Make sure to set the `$START_TIME`, `$END_TIME`, `$FILEPATH`, and `$output_tmp_path` variables before running this command.

## USER
is "-c copy" the same as "-codec copy"?

## ASSISTANT
Yes, "-c copy" and "-codec copy" are equivalent options in FFmpeg, and both options copy the audio and video codecs without re-encoding them. You can use either of these options to achieve the same result.
