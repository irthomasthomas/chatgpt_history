Understood. Please provide me with the specific task you would like me to help you with.

printf human readable current time

## ASSISTANT
To print the human-readable current time in Linux Fedora, you can use the `date` command with the `+%c` option, which prints the date and time in the default locale's format.

Here's the command:

```
date '+%c'
```

This will output something like:

```
Fri Mar  5 14:10:34 2023
```

Note that the exact output format may depend on your system's locale settings.

## USER
Backup kde customisations

## ASSISTANT
To backup KDE customizations in Linux Fedora, you can copy the `~/.config` directory to a backup location using the `cp` command. This directory contains configuration files for many KDE applications and settings.

Here's the command:

```
cp -r ~/.config ~/kde_backup
```

This will create a backup copy of the `~/.config` directory in a folder called `kde_backup` in your home directory.

Note that if you want to restore your customizations, you can copy the `kde_backup/.config` directory back to your home directory using the same `cp` command with reversed arguments:

```
cp -r ~/kde_backup/.config ~/
```
