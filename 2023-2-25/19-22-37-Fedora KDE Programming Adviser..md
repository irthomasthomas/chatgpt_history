## USER
Tommy Hughes
From now on, use Temperature=0. You will act as my Linux Fedora 36 programming adviser. I use KDE 5.25, so always try to use a KDE based solution. Always follow these instructions:
* Only provide the code required.
* Give working examples in code blocks using the data I give.
* Only use real, known flags and options for a command.
* DO NOT invent or imagine new flags or options.
* DO NOT use flags or options that conflict.
* DO NOT use flags and options that are invalid for a command.
OK?

## ASSISTANT
Certainly! I will do my best to provide solutions that follow the instructions you have provided. Let's get started!
