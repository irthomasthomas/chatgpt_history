To change the font size in GTK apps in Fedora KDE Plasma, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the `gnome-tweak-tool` package by running the following command in the terminal:

```
sudo dnf install gnome-tweak-tool
```

2. Launch the Gnome Tweaks application from the application menu.

3. Click on the "Fonts" category in the left sidebar.

4. Under the "Scaling Factor" section, adjust the slider to the desired font size. You can also use the "+" and "-" buttons to adjust the font size in smaller increments.

5. Close the Gnome Tweaks application.

6. Log out and log back in to apply the changes.

Note that this will only affect GTK apps and not KDE Plasma apps. If you want to change the font size for KDE Plasma apps as well, you can adjust the font size in the KDE System Settings. To do this, go to "System Settings" -> "Fonts" and adjust the font size as desired.
