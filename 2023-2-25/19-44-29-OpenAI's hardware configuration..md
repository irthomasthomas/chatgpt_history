Does openai use text-davinci-002 for chatgpt, or text-davinci-003?

## ASSISTANT
As of my knowledge cutoff date of 2021-09, OpenAI was using the text-davinci-002 model for ChatGPT. However, it's possible that since then, OpenAI has updated their models and may now be using text-davinci-003 for ChatGPT or have introduced new models altogether. OpenAI regularly updates their models and offerings, so it's always best to check the most up-to-date information on their website or blog.
