## USER
List all bash operators.

## ASSISTANT
Here is a list of common operators used in bash scripts:

1. Arithmetic Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**` (exponentiation), `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `**=`

2. Comparison Operators: `-eq`, `-ne`, `-gt`, `-ge`, `-lt`, `-le`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`

3. Logical Operators: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)

4. String Operators: `=`, `!=`, `-z` (string is null), `-n` (string is not null), `<`, `>`

5. File Test Operators: `-d` (directory), `-e` (exists), `-f` (file), `-r` (readable), `-s` (size is greater than 0), `-w` (writable), `-x` (executable), `-O` (owned by user), `-G` (owned by group)

6. Regular Expression Matching Operators: `=~`, `!~`

7. Conditional Operators: `-a` (AND), `-o` (OR)

8. Ternary Operators: `?:`

Note that this is not an exhaustive list and some of the operators may not be available in all shell implementations.

## USER
Erase the value of a variable

## ASSISTANT
To erase the value of a variable in bash, you can use the following syntax:

```
unset variable_name
```

For example:

```
foo=42
echo $foo # outputs 42
unset foo
echo $foo # outputs nothing
```

After running the `unset` command, the variable `foo` no longer exists and any attempts to reference it will result in an empty value.

## USER
Pass an optional variable to a function

## ASSISTANT
In bash, you can pass an optional variable to a function by providing a default value for the variable in the function definition. If the variable is not passed to the function, the default value will be used.

Here's an example:

```
function print_message {
  message=${1:-Hello World}
  echo $message
}

print_message # outputs "Hello World"
print_message "Hello Bash" # outputs "Hello Bash"
```

In this example, the function `print_message` takes an optional argument `$1`. If `$1` is not provided, the default value `Hello World` is assigned to the `message` variable. If `$1` is provided, the provided value is assigned to `message`. The function then outputs the value of `message`.

## USER
What is the correct way print to console from a function that needs to return a string without polluting the return value?

## ASSISTANT
To print to the console from a function while preserving the return value, you can use the following approach:

```
function get_message {
  message="Hello World"
  echo $message
}

function print_message {
  message=$(get_message)
  echo $message
  return $message
}

output=$(print_message)
echo "Output: $output" # Output: Hello World
```

In this example, the function `get_message` returns the string `Hello World`. The function `print_message` calls `get_message` and captures its output using command substitution (`$(...)`). The captured output is assigned to the `message` variable, which is then printed to the console using `echo`. The function then returns the value of `message` as its return value.

This allows you to print the value of a variable to the console for debugging purposes, without affecting the function's return value. The return value can still be captured and used as needed.

## USER
Send a file to trash

## ASSISTANT
To send a file to trash in a bash script, you can use the `trash` command, which is available in some Linux distributions.

Here's an example:

```
trash file.txt
```

This will move the file `file.txt` to the trash folder, where it can be recovered later if needed.

If the `trash` command is not available on your system, you can achieve the same result by moving the file to a trash folder manually. Here's an example:

```
trash_folder=~/.local/share/Trash/files
mkdir -p $trash_folder
mv file.txt $trash_folder
```

This will move the file `file.txt` to the `~/.local/share/Trash/files` folder, which is the default trash folder in some Linux distributions.

## USER
ffmpeg automatically overwrite

## ASSISTANT
By default, FFmpeg will not overwrite an existing file. If you want to automatically overwrite an existing file without prompting for confirmation, you can use the `-y` (or `--yes`) option.

Here's an example:

```
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 20 -y output.mp4
```

In this example, FFmpeg will convert the input file `input.mp4` to H.264 video using the libx264 codec and a constant rate factor of 20. The `-y` option will automatically overwrite the output file `output.mp4` if it already exists.

Note that using the `-y` option can be dangerous as it can result in data loss if you accidentally overwrite a file that you didn't mean to. Use this option with caution.
