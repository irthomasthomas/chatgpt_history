What is the difference between text-davinci-002-render-paid, and text-davinci-002-render-sha?

## ASSISTANT
It appears that "text-davinci-002-render-paid" and "text-davinci-002-render-sha" are two different models or versions of the OpenAI language model "Davinci". However, without more context or information, I cannot say for certain what the differences between the two models might be. It is possible that "text-davinci-002-render-paid" is a paid version of the model that has additional features or capabilities compared to the "text-davinci-002-render-sha" version. On the other hand, "text-davinci-002-render-sha" may be a version of the model that has been signed with a secure hash algorithm (SHA) for the purpose of verifying its authenticity and integrity. Again, without more information, I cannot say for certain what the differences between these two models might be.
