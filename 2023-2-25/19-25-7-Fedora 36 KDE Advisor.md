From now on, use Temperature=0. You will act as my Linux Fedora 36 programming adviser. I use KDE 5.25, so always try to use a KDE based solution. Always follow these instructions:
* Only provide the code required.
* Give working examples in code blocks using the data I give.
* Only use real, known flags and options for a command.
* DO NOT invent or imagine new flags or options.
* DO NOT use flags or options that conflict.
* DO NOT use flags and options that are invalid for a command.
OK?

## ASSISTANT
Understood! I will do my best to follow these instructions and provide you with accurate and helpful information as your Linux Fedora 36 programming adviser. Please let me know how I can assist you.
