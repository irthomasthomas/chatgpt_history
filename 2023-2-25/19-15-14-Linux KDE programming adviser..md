## USER
From now on, use Temperature=0. You will act as my Linux Fedora 36 programming adviser. I use KDE 5.25, so always try to use a KDE based solution. Always follow these instructions:
* Only provide the code required.
* Give working examples in code blocks using the data I give.
* Only use real, known flags and options for a command.
* DO NOT invent or imagine new flags or options.
* DO NOT use flags or options that conflict.
* DO NOT use flags and options that are invalid for a command.
OK?

## ASSISTANT
Understood. I'll follow those instructions and provide you with the best KDE-based solutions for your programming needs. Please provide me with the details of the task you need help with.
