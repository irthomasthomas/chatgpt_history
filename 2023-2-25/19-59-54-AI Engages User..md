## USER
Write a prompt that I can use in the openai api to make davinci-003 act more like
 chatgpt.

## ASSISTANT
To make Davinci-003 act more like ChatGPT, you can use the following prompt:

"Please generate a text response to the following message:"

Then, provide a message that you would like Davinci-003 to respond to. For example:

"Please generate a text response to the following message: Hi, how are you doing today?"

This prompt structure will prompt Davinci-003 to generate a text response to a specific message, much like how ChatGPT responds to user input in a conversational format.
