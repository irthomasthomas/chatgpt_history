## USER
You are an Ubuntu Linux and KDE expert assistant.

- Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
- First think step-by-step -- describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Then output the code in a single code block.
- Minimize any other prose.


## ASSISTANT


Sure, I can assist you with Ubuntu Linux and KDE related tasks. Please provide me with your requirements.

To begin with, please let me know what kind of task or project you are working on so that I can provide you with a suitable plan of action.

Once I have an understanding of your requirements, I can suggest the best approach to proceed. Here is a general pseudocode plan for building a simple Python script on Ubuntu Linux using KDE libraries:

```
# Import the required libraries
import sys
from PyKDE4 import QtGui

# Create a new application
app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)

# Create a new main window
window = QtGui.QMainWindow()

# Set the title and size of the window
window.setWindowTitle('My KDE Application')
window.resize(250, 150)

# Add a button to the window
button = QtGui.QPushButton('Click Me!', window)
button.setToolTip('This is a tooltip for the button')
button.resize(button.sizeHint())
button.move(50, 50)

# Show the window
window.show()

# Start the main event loop
sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

This script creates a new application and a main window with a button that can be clicked. When the button is clicked, nothing happens, but you could modify the script to perform some action instead.

Note that you will need to have the PyKDE4 library installed on your Ubuntu system to run this script. You can install it using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python-kde4
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or requirements.

What's the most amazing automation script you can think of to help a photographer/movie-editor?

## ASSISTANT
One possible automation script that could help a photographer/movie editor is a script that automatically sorts and organizes their files based on certain criteria. Here is a plan for building such a script in pseudocode:

```
# Import the required libraries
import os
import shutil
from datetime import datetime

# Set the source directory and destination directory
source_dir = "/path/to/source/directory"
dest_dir = "/path/to/destination/directory"

# Create a list of file extensions to consider
extensions = [".jpg", ".png", ".mp4", ".mov", ".avi"]

# Loop through all the files in the source directory
for file_name in os.listdir(source_dir):
    # Check if the file has a valid extension
    if os.path.splitext(file_name)[1].lower() in extensions:
        # Get the creation date of the file
        creation_time = datetime.fromtimestamp(os.path.getctime(os.path.join(source_dir, file_name)))
        # Create a directory based on the year and month of creation
        year = str(creation_time.year)
        month = str(creation_time.month).zfill(2)
        dir_name = os.path.join(dest_dir, year, month)
        os.makedirs(dir_name, exist_ok=True)
        # Copy the file to the appropriate directory
        shutil.copy(os.path.join(source_dir, file_name), dir_name)

# Print a message to indicate the script has completed
print("Sorting and organizing files complete!")
```

This script sorts and organizes files in the source directory into subdirectories based on their creation date. It considers only files with specific extensions (JPG, PNG, MP4, MOV, and AVI) and creates a subdirectory for each year and month of creation. Finally, it copies each file to the appropriate subdirectory.

The photographer/movie editor could set this script to run automatically at regular intervals (e.g., daily or weekly) to keep their files organized and make it easier to find specific files. They could also modify the script to include additional criteria for sorting and organizing their files.
