Merge sqlite databases

## ASSISTANT
To merge two SQLite databases, you can follow these general steps:

1. Attach the second database to the first one using the `ATTACH` command.
2. Copy the data from the attached database to the main database using SQL statements.
3. Detach the second database.

Here's an example of how you can merge two SQLite databases using the `sqlite3` command-line tool:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing your first SQLite database file (`database1.db`).
2. Start the `sqlite3` command-line tool and open the first database file:

```
sqlite3 database1.db
```

3. Attach the second database file (`database2.db`) to the first one using the following command:

```
ATTACH 'database2.db' AS db2;
```

4. Use SQL statements to copy the data from the attached database to the main database. For example, if you want to copy all the data from a table called `mytable` in the attached database to a table with the same name in the main database, you can use the following command:

```
INSERT INTO mytable SELECT * FROM db2.mytable;
```

5. Repeat step 4 for all the tables you want to copy from the attached database to the main database.

6. Detach the second database using the following command:

```
DETACH DATABASE db2;
```

7. Exit the `sqlite3` command-line tool:

```
.exit
```

After following these steps, your two databases should be merged into a single database file (`database1.db`) containing all the data from both original databases.

## USER
Write a script that automates the task

## ASSISTANT
Here's an example Python script that automates the process of merging two SQLite databases:

```python
import sqlite3

# specify the filenames of the two databases to be merged
database1_filename = 'database1.db'
database2_filename = 'database2.db'

# connect to the first database
conn1 = sqlite3.connect(database1_filename)

# attach the second database to the first one
conn1.execute(f"ATTACH '{database2_filename}' AS db2;")

# get a list of all the tables in the second database
cursor = conn1.execute("SELECT name FROM db2.sqlite_master WHERE type='table';")
tables = [row[0] for row in cursor]

# loop through each table and copy the data to the first database
for table in tables:
    conn1.execute(f"INSERT INTO {table} SELECT * FROM db2.{table};")

# detach the second database
conn1.execute("DETACH DATABASE db2;")

# commit the changes and close the connection to the first database
conn1.commit()
conn1.close()
```

To use this script, simply replace the filenames `database1.db` and `database2.db` with the filenames of the two databases you want to merge. Then, run the script using a Python interpreter. Note that you'll need to have the `sqlite3` module installed in order to use this script.
