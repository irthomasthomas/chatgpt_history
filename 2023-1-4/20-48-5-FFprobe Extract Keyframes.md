explaine this: ffprobe -loglevel error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries packet=pts_time,flags -of csv=print_section=0 video.mp4 | awk -F',' '/K/ {print $1}'


## ASSISTANT
This command uses the `ffprobe` utility to extract information from a video file `video.mp4`. 

The `-loglevel error` flag specifies that only error messages should be printed. 

The `-select_streams v:0` flag specifies that only information from the first video stream should be extracted. 

The `-show_entries` flag specifies which information should be extracted. In this case, `packet=pts_time,flags` specifies that the presentation timestamps (pts) and flags for each packet should be extracted. 

The `-of csv=print_section=0` flag specifies that the extracted information should be output in CSV format, with no section headers. 

The output from `ffprobe` is then piped to `awk`, which processes the output further. The `awk` command filters the output to only include lines containing the letter `K` (which would represent keyframe packets, since the `flags` field for a keyframe packet contains the letter `K`). For these lines, the `awk` command prints the first field (which is the pts_time field, the presentation timestamp of the packet).

## USER
What could I use instead of pts_time?

## ASSISTANT
You can use `dts_time` instead of `pts_time` to extract the decode timestamps (dts) of the packets instead of the presentation timestamps (pts).

The decode timestamp (dts) is the timestamp at which a packet is to be decoded, while the presentation timestamp (pts) is the timestamp at which a packet is to be presented to the viewer. In most cases, the dts and pts will be the same, but in some cases (e.g. when B-frames are used), the dts and pts may be different.

You can also extract other information about the packets, such as the size of the packet in bytes (`size`) or the duration of the packet (`duration`). You can see a full list of the fields that are available for the `packet` show_entry by running `ffprobe -hide_banner -help format_tags | grep packet`.
