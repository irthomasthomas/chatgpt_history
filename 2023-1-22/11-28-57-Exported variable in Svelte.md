## USER
What does this mean in svelte?
<script>
	export let answer;
</script>

## ASSISTANT
This script exports a variable called "answer" which can be accessed by other components in a Svelte project. The "export" keyword makes the variable available for import by other components, allowing them to access and use the value of the variable. In this case, the value of "answer" is not set or initialized within this script, and it is likely being passed in as a prop from a parent component.
