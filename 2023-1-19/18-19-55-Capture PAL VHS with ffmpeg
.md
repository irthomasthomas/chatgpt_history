What is the best way to capture pal vhs with ffmpeg?

## ASSISTANT
To capture PAL VHS with ffmpeg, you can use the following command:

```
ffmpeg -f alsa -i pulse -f v4l2 -s 720x576 -i /dev/video0 -c:v mpeg2video -qscale:v 2 -c:a mp2 -b:a 192k output.mpg
```

This command captures the audio using ALSA (the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) with the input device set to pulse, and the video using the Video4Linux2 (V4L2) device with a resolution of 720x576 and saves the output as an MPEG-2 video file with a specified video bitrate of 2 and audio bitrate of 192kbps.

Note: This command is an example, you may need to adjust the options depending on your specific setup.
