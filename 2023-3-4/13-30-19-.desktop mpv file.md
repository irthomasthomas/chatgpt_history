## ASSISTANT
Understood, I will follow your instructions and provide you with accurate and concise solutions to your Linux Fedora programming questions.

## USER
Run mpv from bash with video info displayed

## ASSISTANT
You can run `mpv` from the terminal and display video information by using the `--osd-level` flag. Here is an example command:

```
mpv --osd-level=2 <video_file>
```

This will play the specified video file and display information such as the filename, video resolution, codec information, and playback time on the screen. You can adjust the OSD (on-screen display) level to display more or less information as needed.

## USER
Write a script and desktop file to use in context menu to open video with mpv with osd always visible.

## ASSISTANT
To create a script and desktop file that will allow you to open a video file with `mpv` and have the OSD always visible, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new file named `mpv-with-osd.sh` and open it in a text editor.

2. Add the following code to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
mpv --osd-level=2 "$1"
```

3. Save and close the file.

4. Set the executable permission on the script by running the following command:

```bash
chmod +x mpv-with-osd.sh
```

5. Create a new file named `mpv-with-osd.desktop` and open it in a text editor.

6. Add the following code to the file:

```
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Name=Open with mpv with OSD
Comment=Open video file with mpv and always show OSD
Exec=/path/to/mpv-with-osd.sh %f
Icon=mpv
Terminal=false
Categories=AudioVideo;
MimeType=video/x-msvideo;video/mpeg;video/quicktime;video/x-flv;video/mp4;video/x-matroska;video/webm;video/vnd.rn-realvideo;video/3gpp;video/x-ms-wmv;
```

7. Replace `/path/to/mpv-with-osd.sh` in the `Exec` line with the actual path to the `mpv-with-osd.sh` script you created earlier.

8. Save and close the file.

9. Move the `mpv-with-osd.desktop` file to `~/.local/share/applications/`.

10. Log out and log back in, or run the following command to update the desktop entries:

```bash
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/
```

Once you have completed these steps, you should be able to right-click on a video file and select "Open with mpv with OSD" from the context menu. This will open the video file with `mpv` and the OSD will always be visible.
