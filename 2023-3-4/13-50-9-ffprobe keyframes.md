Find the nearest keyframe (i-frame) before a given timestamp in an mp4.

## ASSISTANT
You can use the `ffprobe` command from FFmpeg to extract information about the video, including the timing of keyframes. Then, you can use some basic shell scripting to find the nearest keyframe before the given timestamp.

Assuming that you have FFmpeg and its tools installed, you can use the following command to extract the keyframe information from the video:

```
ffprobe -select_streams v:0 -skip_frame nokey -show_entries frame=pkt_pts_time -of csv <input_file>
```

This command selects the first video stream (`-select_streams v:0`), skips frames that are not keyframes (`-skip_frame nokey`), and outputs the timestamps of each frame in CSV format (`-show_entries frame=pkt_pts_time -of csv`).

You can then pipe this output to a script that finds the nearest keyframe before the given timestamp. Here's an example script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

input_file=$1
target_time=$2

while read -r timestamp; do
  if (( $(echo "$timestamp <= $target_time" | bc -l) )); then
    last_keyframe=$timestamp
  else
    break
  fi
done < <(ffprobe -select_streams v:0 -skip_frame nokey -show_entries frame=pkt_pts_time -of csv "$input_file")

echo "$last_keyframe"
```

To use this script, save it as a file (e.g., `find_nearest_keyframe.sh`) and make it executable (`chmod +x find_nearest_keyframe.sh`). Then, you can run it with the input file and target timestamp as arguments:

```
./find_nearest_keyframe.sh <input_file> <target_time>
```

For example, if you want to find the nearest keyframe before the timestamp 10.5 seconds in the file `video.mp4`, you would run:

```
./find_nearest_keyframe.sh video.mp4 10.5
```

## USER
From a bash script, open a video in mpv, and then from another script, seek to the given time.

## ASSISTANT
To open a video in mpv from a bash script, you can use the `mpv` command followed by the video file path. For example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mpv /path/to/video.mp4
```

To seek to a specific time in the video from another script, you can use the `mpv` command with the `--start` option followed by the desired time in seconds. For example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mpv --start=60 /path/to/video.mp4
```

This will open the video and seek to the 60 second mark.

To combine these two scripts, you can use the `&` operator to run the first script in the background while the second script runs. For example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

/path/to/open_video_script.sh &
sleep 5 # wait for video to open
/path/to/seek_video_script.sh
```

This script runs the `open_video_script.sh` script in the background, waits for 5 seconds (adjust as needed depending on how long it takes for the video to open), and then runs the `seek_video_script.sh` script. The `&` operator runs the `open_video_script.sh` script in the background, so the `sleep` command is necessary to wait for the video to open before seeking to the desired time.

silence ffmpeg output

## ASSISTANT
To silence the output of FFmpeg, you can use the `-v` option to set the verbosity level to `quiet` or `-loglevel` option to set the log level to `panic`. Both of these options will suppress all console output from FFmpeg, including errors, warnings, and informational messages.

Here's an example command that uses the `-loglevel` option to silence FFmpeg output:

```
ffmpeg -loglevel panic -i input.mp4 -c:a copy output.mp4
```

In this command, FFmpeg reads an input video file `input.mp4` and copies the audio stream to an output file `output.mp4`. The `-loglevel panic` option silences all FFmpeg output.

Note that this will suppress all console output from FFmpeg, including any errors or warnings that may be important for debugging. If you want to silence only certain types of output (e.g., warnings), you can use different log levels (`quiet`, `panic`, `fatal`, `error`, `warning`, `info`, `verbose`, or `debug`) with the `-v` option. For example:

```
ffmpeg -v warning -i input.mp4 -c:a copy output.mp4
```

This command sets the verbosity level to `warning`, which will suppress all output except for warnings and errors.

## USER
ffmpeg -hide_banner -v warning -ss "$START_TIME" -i "$FILEPATH" -c copy -to "$END_TIME" -y "$output_tmp_path" 2>&1 >/dev/null &

Fix the above command so that ffmpeg cilps to the actual time of the END_TIME timestamp

## ASSISTANT
To clip the video to the actual time of the `END_TIME` timestamp, you can use the `-t` option instead of the `-to` option when running FFmpeg. The `-t` option specifies the duration of the output video, so you can calculate the duration by subtracting the start time from the end time.

Here's the fixed command:

```
ffmpeg -hide_banner -v warning -ss "$START_TIME" -i "$FILEPATH" -c copy -t $(echo "$END_TIME-$START_TIME" | bc) -y "$output_tmp_path" 2>&1 >/dev/null &
```

In this command, the `-t` option is used to specify the duration of the output video, which is calculated by subtracting the start time (`$START_TIME`) from the end time (`$END_TIME`) using the `bc` command. The `-to` option has been removed.
