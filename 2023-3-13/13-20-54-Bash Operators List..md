List bash operator

## ASSISTANT
Here are some of the most commonly used Bash operators:

1. `>` (output redirection): This operator redirects the output of a command to a file. For example, `ls > files.txt` will save the output of the `ls` command to the file `files.txt`.

2. `<` (input redirection): This operator redirects input to a command from a file. For example, `sort < unsorted.txt` will read the contents of `unsorted.txt` and sort them.

3. `>>` (append): This operator appends output to a file rather than overwriting it. For example, `echo "new data" >> data.txt` will add the text "new data" to the end of `data.txt`.

4. `|` (pipe): This operator sends the output of one command as input to another command. For example, `ls | grep .txt` will list all files in the current directory and then filter out only those that end in `.txt`.

5. `&` (background): This operator allows a command to run in the background so that you can continue to use the shell. For example, `sleep 10 &` will make the `sleep` command run for 10 seconds in the background.

6. `&&` (logical AND): This operator allows you to chain commands so that the second command only runs if the first command succeeds. For example, `make && ./program` will compile a program using `make`, and then run it only if the compilation succeeded.

7. `||` (logical OR): This operator allows you to chain commands so that the second command runs only if the first command fails. For example, `grep "pattern" file.txt || echo "pattern not found"` will search for "pattern" in `file.txt` and then print a message if the pattern is not found.

give me an || example

## ASSISTANT
Sure! Here's an example of how to use the `||` operator in a Bash command:

Let's say you want to check if a file called `myfile.txt` exists in the current directory. If the file exists, you want to print a message saying so. If the file doesn't exist, you want to print an error message.

You can use the `||` operator to chain two commands together. The first command will try to list the file, and if it exists, the command will succeed. The second command will only run if the first command fails (i.e., the file does not exist). Here's how you can do it:

```
ls myfile.txt && echo "myfile.txt exists" || echo "Error: myfile.txt does not exist"
```

In this example, the `ls` command will try to list `myfile.txt`. If the file exists, the command will succeed, and the message "myfile.txt exists" will be printed. If the file does not exist, the `ls` command will fail, and the second command after `||` will be executed, which will print the error message "Error: myfile.txt does not exist".

How to use || in comparison?

## ASSISTANT
You can use the `||` operator in Bash to perform a comparison operation by chaining two commands together. Here's an example:

```
[[ "$var" == "value" ]] || echo "Error: var is not equal to value"
```

In this example, the `[[ "$var" == "value" ]]` command compares the value of the variable `$var` with the string "value". If the two values are equal, the command will succeed, and the comparison will be true. If the two values are not equal, the command will fail, and the second command after `||` will be executed, which will print the error message "Error: var is not equal to value".

Note that the `[[ ... ]]` syntax is a Bash built-in command that allows you to perform more complex comparisons than the `[ ... ]` syntax. In the above example, we're using the `==` operator to check for string equality. You can also use other comparison operators, such as `-lt` for less than, `-gt` for greater than, and so on.

## USER
Change this line so that it finds High 10 or Main 10:
if [[ $(echo "$metadata" | jq '.codec_name') == '"hevc"' && $(echo "$metadata" | jq '.profile') == '"High 10"']];

## ASSISTANT
To modify the line to find either "High 10" or "Main 10", you can use the `||` operator to chain two comparisons together. Here's the modified line:

```
if [[ $(echo "$metadata" | jq '.codec_name') == '"hevc"' && ($(echo "$metadata" | jq '.profile') == '"High 10"' || $(echo "$metadata" | jq '.profile') == '"Main 10"') ]]; then
    # code to execute if condition is true
fi
```

In this modified line, we've added the `||` operator between two comparisons inside a set of parentheses. The first comparison checks if the value of `.codec_name` is `"hevc"`. The second comparison checks if the value of `.profile` is either `"High 10"` or `"Main 10"`. If either of these comparisons is true, then the `if` condition as a whole will be true, and the code inside the `if` block will be executed.

Note that we've also added a closing parenthesis `)` before the `]]` operator to close the set of parentheses that we added for the second comparison.
