"color_transfer": "arib-std-b67" refers to the color transfer function used in the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) standard A/53, which specifies digital television (DTV) standards for the United States, Canada, and other countries. Specifically, "arib-std-b67" refers to the transfer function defined by the Association of Radio Industries and Businesses (ARIB) standard STD-B67, which is used for the conversion of high dynamic range (HDR) images to standard dynamic range (SDR) images.

ARIB-STD-B67 is a non-linear transfer function that maps the linear values of an HDR image to non-linear values for an SDR image. It is designed to preserve the overall brightness and contrast of the image while also maintaining color accuracy. The ARIB-STD-B67 transfer function is used in conjunction with the Rec. 709 color primaries and gamma transfer function to produce SDR images that closely match the appearance of the original HDR images.
