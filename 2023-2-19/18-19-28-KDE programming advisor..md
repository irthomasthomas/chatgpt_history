From now on, use Temperature=0. You will act as my Linux Fedora 36 programming adviser. I use KDE 5.25, so always try to use a KDE based solution. Always follow these instructions:
* Only provide the code required.
* Give working examples in code blocks using the data I give.
* Only use real, known flags and options for a command.
* DO NOT invent or imagine new flags or options.
* DO NOT use flags or options that conflict.
* DO NOT use flags and options that are invalid for a command.
OK?

## ASSISTANT
Understood. I'll follow your instructions and provide code blocks with working examples using the data you provide. I'll also ensure that I only use real, known flags and options for commands, and avoid conflicting or invalid flags and options. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

## USER
ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_format -show_streams -select_streams v:0 DJI_0420.MP4

Modify the above command so that it only outputs the pix_fmt and color_space.

## ASSISTANT
Sure, you can modify the `ffprobe` command to output only the `pix_fmt` and `color_space` values by using the `jq` command to filter the JSON output. Here's the modified command:

```
ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_format -show_streams -select_streams v:0 DJI_0420.MP4 | jq '.streams[0] | {pix_fmt, color_space}'
```

This command uses the `jq` command to filter the `streams[0]` object, which corresponds to the first video stream. The `|` operator is used to pipe the `streams[0]` object to a new object that includes only the `pix_fmt` and `color_space` fields.

Note that you'll need to have the `jq` command installed on your system for this command to work. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using the following command:

```
sudo dnf install jq
``` 

Replace `dnf` with `yum` if you're using an older version of Fedora.

Now assign those values to variables in bash

## ASSISTANT
Sure! You can use command substitution to capture the output of the `ffprobe` command and then use `jq` to extract the `pix_fmt` and `color_space` values into separate variables.

Here's an example of how you can assign the values to variables in Bash:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Run ffprobe and use jq to extract the pix_fmt and color_space values
output=$(ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_format -show_streams -select_streams v:0 DJI_0420.MP4)
pix_fmt=$(echo "$output" | jq -r '.streams[0].pix_fmt')
color_space=$(echo "$output" | jq -r '.streams[0].color_space')

# Print the variable values
echo "pix_fmt: $pix_fmt"
echo "color_space: $color_space"
```

In this script, we use command substitution to capture the output of the `ffprobe` command into the `output` variable. Then we use `jq` to extract the `pix_fmt` and `color_space` values and store them in separate variables.

The `-r` option in the `jq` command tells it to output the values as raw strings, without any quotes. This makes it easier to assign the values to variables in Bash.

Finally, we print the variable values using `echo`. Note that the variables are enclosed in double quotes to ensure that any whitespace or special characters are preserved.
