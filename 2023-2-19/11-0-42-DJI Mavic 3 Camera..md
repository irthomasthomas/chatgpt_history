## ASSISTANT
From the provided JSON file, we can tell that the video stream was encoded using the HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) codec in Main 10 profile, which is a highly efficient compression algorithm for video. The video has a resolution of 5120 x 2700 pixels and is in the yuv420p10le pixel format, which means that it uses 10 bits per color channel. The video has a level of 180, which refers to the maximum bit rate and frame rate allowed for this video. 

The video has a color range of "tv" and a color space, transfer function, and primaries of "bt709", which are commonly used standards for HDTV. The video has a chroma location of "left" which means the chroma information is located on the leftmost column of pixels.

Based on the information in the JSON file, we can conclude that the video is of high quality and has been shot with a DJI Mavic 3 camera, which is known to produce high-quality video footage.

Was it shot in Normal, HLG, or D-LOG?

## ASSISTANT
Unfortunately, the provided JSON file does not contain any information about whether the video was shot in Normal, HLG, or D-LOG. These are different picture profiles or color modes that can be used while shooting with a DJI Mavic 3 camera.

To determine which picture profile was used to shoot the video, you may need to examine the video file itself or any accompanying metadata. Some video files, such as those in the MP4 format, may contain additional metadata that can provide this information. Alternatively, you could try reaching out to the person who shot the video and ask them about the picture profile they used.
