## ASSISTANT
INT. MONK'S CAFE - DAY
Jerry, George, Kramer and Elaine are seated at their usual booth. 

Jerry: (wearing a red MAGA hat) I finally got this hat, it’s all the rage!

Elaine: (rolls her eyes) Jerry, what are you thinking? That hat represents hate!

Jerry: (defensive) Hey, it’s just a hat!

George: (jokingly) Yeah, and it makes you look like a clown.

Jerry: (laughing) Very funny.

Kramer enters, sees Jerry's hat and stops in his tracks.

Kramer: (excited) Jerry! I heard about your hat, can I try it on?

Jerry: (handing Kramer the hat) Sure, knock yourself out.

Kramer: (puts on the hat) How do I look?

George: (serious tone) Like a complete fool.

Elaine: (sarcastic) Oh, Kramer, it’s the perfect accessory for your wacky personality.

Kramer: (ignoring the comments) I’m going to wear this to the pro-Trump rally downtown.

Jerry: (laughing) Good luck with that.

The scene ends with the friends laughing and enjoying their coffee as Kramer exits the café with the MAGA hat still on his head.

INT. MONK'S CAFE - DAY
Jerry, George, Kramer, and Elaine are seated at their usual booth.

Jerry: (excited) You guys won't believe what I just got!

Elaine: (curious) What is it, Jerry?

Jerry: (proudly) A Hunter laptop! It's the latest and greatest in hunting technology.

George: (dumbfounded) Hunting technology? What do you need that for?

Jerry: (enthusiastic) I'm going on a hunting trip next week and this laptop will help me track game, find the best hunting spots, and even predict weather patterns.

Kramer enters and sees the laptop on the table.

Kramer: (impressed) Wow, what's that Jerry?

Jerry: (smiling) It's my new Hunter laptop.

Kramer: (interested) Can I take a look?

Jerry: (handing Kramer the laptop) Sure, go ahead.

Kramer starts using the laptop and suddenly stops.

Kramer: (serious) Jerry, you have a virus on your laptop.

Jerry: (concerned) What do you mean?

Kramer: (explaining) It's a hunting virus. It's infected all your files and is now spreading to other computers.

Elaine: (alarmed) What do we do?

Kramer: (determined) I'll call my IT guy. He'll take care of it.

The scene ends with Kramer on the phone with his IT guy, trying to resolve the issue, as the rest of the friends look on with worried expressions.

"George: (serious) Jerry, you have a virus on your laptop."
Make this more like:  "George: (serious) Oh my god"

"Jerry: (concerned) What's the problem?"

George: (explaining) This is no hunters laptop, Jerry. This is THE Hunter laptop!

Jerry: What?

George: It's THE Hunter laptop, you know, with the videos in the bathtub.

Elaine: (alarmed) It's a Hunter laptop?

George: You gotta see this video, Jerry.

George plays a video and Elaine and Jerry look over.

Elaine: What is the appeal with the foot fetish, anyway.

Jerry: Well, I would think, if you have to touch that disgusting thing, you want to be as far away from it as possible. 

Elaine: Yeah right.... here's a sweaty foot with bunions

Jerry: What is he doing now?

Elaine: You shouldn't put that in there.

All three of them recoil in shock.

George: I can't look.

Jerry: (shocked) Oh my god, no! I touched that thing (holds his up in front of him) it was on top of my lap!

## ASSISTANT
George: (serious) Oh my god!

Jerry: (concerned) What's the problem?

Elaine: (alarmed) Foot fetish videos?

George: You gotta see this video, Jerry.

George plays a video and Elaine and Jerry look over.

Elaine: (disgusted) What is the appeal with the foot fetish anyway?

Jerry: (disgusted) I don't know, but I would think if you have to touch those things, you want to be as far away from them as possible.

Elaine: (nodding) Yeah, I don't understand it either. And this video is just...ew...sweaty feet with bunions.

Jerry: (disgusted) What is he doing now?

Elaine: (alarmed) You shouldn't put that in there!

All three of them recoil in shock.

George: (disgusted) I can't look.

Jerry: (disgusted) Oh my god, no! I touched that thing! (holds his hands up in front of him) It was on top of my lap!

## ASSISTANT
Jerry: (disgusted) What is he doing now?

George: (nervously) Uh, guys...I think this might be considered an indecent proposal.

Elaine: (alarmed) What?

Jerry: (surprised) Are you kidding me?!

George: (quickly closing the laptop) Alright, that's enough of that.

Jerry: (disgusted) I can't believe I was going to use this for hunting. I'd rather hunt down the person who made this video.

Elaine: (shuddering) Ugh, the thought of those sweaty feet with bunions...it's enough to make me never want to hunt again.

Jerry: (laughing) That's okay, I think we can all agree that this laptop is better suited for catching game in the tub.

All three of them break out in laughter.

Jerry: (smiling) You know what they say, there's no hunting like bathtub hunting.

Elaine: (laughing) Oh, Jerry, you never cease to surprise me.

George: (laughing) I think I'll stick to my trusty binoculars from now on.

Jerry: (smiling) Me too. Hunting technology is overrated anyways.

Neuman: (confident) Hey guys, what's the problem?

Kramer: (explains) Jerry's laptop has a virus, and it's spreading to other computers.

Neuman: (calm) No problem. Let me take a look.

Neuman starts working on the laptop, checking for the virus and its source.

Jerry: (anxious) Is it serious?

Neuman: (professional) Not too bad. It's a common virus, but it's important to get rid of it right away.

Jerry: (relieved) Thank you, Neuman.

Neuman: (smiling) No problem, that's what I'm here for. I'll have this taken care of in no time.

The group watches as Neuman works on the laptop, and soon enough, the virus is removed and the laptop is back to its normal functioning state.

Jerry: (grateful) Thanks again, Neuman.

Neuman: (smiling) Anytime, Jerry. Stay safe on that hunting trip, and don't let any more viruses get you.

Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer all breathe a sigh of relief and continue on with their day, grateful for Neuman's expertise in handling the laptop crisis.
