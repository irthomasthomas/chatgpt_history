Give me a practical guide to get started with Emacs and org-mode

## ASSISTANT
Here is a practical guide to get started with Emacs and org-mode:

1. Download and install Emacs. You can download the latest version of Emacs from the official website (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

2. Open Emacs and type `M-x org-mode` (`M` means `Alt` key on Windows or Linux, `Cmd` key on MacOS) to enable org-mode. This will open a new buffer with the default org-mode settings.

3. Create a new file in org-mode by typing `C-x C-f` (`C` means `Ctrl` key) and then entering the file name with the `.org` extension.

4. Organize your tasks by creating headings and subheadings. To create a new heading, press `*` followed by a space. To create a subheading, press `**` followed by a space.

5. Use the `TAB` key to cycle through different heading levels and the `S-TAB` key to cycle in the opposite direction.

6. To schedule a task, add a `DEADLINE:` or `SCHEDULED:` property to a heading. You can also set a deadline or schedule by using the `C-c C-d` key combination.

7. Create a TODO list by adding `TODO` keywords to headings. Use the `C-c C-t` key combination to cycle through different TODO states, such as `DONE`.

8. Use `C-c C-s` to set a priority to a task, and `C-c C-x p` to show all tasks in order of priority.

9. To create a link to another file or website, use the `C-c C-l` key combination.

10. Finally, use `C-c C-c` to save the file and `C-x C-s` to save it as.

With this basic guide you should be able to use most of the Org-mode features, such as scheduling, prioritizing and tracking tasks, and creating outlines. Remember that org-mode is a powerful tool and has a lot of features and customizations, it's always good to explore the documentation and check other resources to get the most of it.
